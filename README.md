# Next_word_predictor_LSTM
# Next Word Predictor using LSTM

This project builds a next-word prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It is trained on a dataset of Indian legal text, including the Constitution of India. 

## ðŸ§  Use Case

This model can assist in:
- **Drafting legal articles**
- **Completing constitutional or legal sentences**
- **Developing AI-assisted legal research tools**
- Educational tools to understand **sentence flow in legal writing**
